# AOC2018

This is my entry into [AOC2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

The algorithms are quick and dirty. These are designed to get the job done, and not necessarily in O(nlogn) time. 
As I have time, I'll go back in and improve on the code and maybe
the algorithms.

## Goal

  * **TDD:** using the examples given in the problem, write the algorithms to solve the test
  * Better learn the language while I solve problems that are outside of my normal 9-to-5 domain of work.

# Languages

  * PHP 7.3
